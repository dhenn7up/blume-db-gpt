# Welcome to Blume GPT! 🚀🤖

Hi there! 👋 This is [my (Prannay Kedia)](https://prannaykedia.com) implementation of the assignment for Blume VC's development internship. The problem statement was:

> **Create a simple chat interface capable of intelligently querying an open-source database**.

There are 2 interpretations of the above problem statement:

1. A chat bot that interacts with a database (Postgres DB) and runs SQL queries from normal human text.
2. A chat bot that analyses your data for you. It might come from a database or from a simple excel file. It's job is to run analyses and do plotting.

To avoid misinterpreting the assignment, I have developed 2 chatbots for each of the above use cases. The links for each of the are listed below.
